Some of the best music ever. Everything else about the game was made by me, (Aka PrestonDragon989). Well, minus the modules used.
## Modules Used
There were really only two modules used for this game:
1. Pygame
2. ModernGL

Pygame is to control a lot of game specific things, and ModernGL is so I can render things quite fast, as well as use shaders. I have been able to pull great frame rates with this setup, and have it look great as well.
## How to Install
You need to have python installed to do any of this, just so you know. First, navigate to the game directory with `cd`. Then, once your there, all you ahve to do is type:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all moduels neccessary. Very fun, and simple. That should be all the ones you need to run it. Then, simply run the game file:
```bash
python3 game.py
```
